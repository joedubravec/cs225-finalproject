Team meetings: Our team will meet weekly on Saturday afternoon for 1 hour over zoom to discuss current progress on the project. Further, we will have an option Wednesday night meeting for 30minutes if we need a quick check in on progression. Finally, Eric will take notes during the meetings if it is deemed fitting, but all the zoom meetings will be recorded for reference.

Assistance: Our communication system will be facebook messenger. During the school week a response is excpected within 2 hours, but over the weekend
(unless a deadline is approaching) a 5 hour response window is expected. 

Respect: All team members will be enouraged to share ideas, or concerns at any point. To make sure all members have the opportunity to speak and share ideas we will always go around the group and ask for comments. Further, we benefit from all being friends so we should know the most effective ways of communicating with eachother from previous interactions. Finally, all comments made about quality of work should be accompianied with a suggestion for improvment and not simply an emphasis of a negative. For example instead of saying "This code sucks, can you rewrite it?" say "This code is hard to understand, could you use clearer variable names and document.

Work Distribution: In general we will expect an even three way split of work, but not necesarilly in type of work. Eric will take the lead on planning, research and documenting work, Joe will take the lead on function implementation, and Ryan will lead bug testing & debugging. All team members will take part in coding, but these names just outline who will be distributing the work. Further, if unexpected work comes up all members will be expected to take on some of it. 

Time Commitment: All three members of the group have similar schedules so we will be opperating in similar time commitment constraints. While the existing MP is wrapping up we do not expected much more than one or two hours spent on the project. Once the final MP is completed we all want to commit 8 hours per week leading into Fall break, 10 hours over fall break, and 10 hours per week until the project due date. If any time conflicts arise with our weekly meeting time it will be the responsibility of the person who had the conflict arise to find a new time that works for all members of the group.

Conflict Resolution: If conflict arises between two members the third members will act as the mediator. In these instances the two people must talk with eachother and clearly express what the issue is. Further, when giving criticism or expressing disagreement there should never be personal attacks aimed at the person, instead statements should be solely focused on the content of the project.
